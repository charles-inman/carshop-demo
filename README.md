# carshop-demo

A simple demo for carshop using react js and node js

Plus ensure you are using node js 8.11.3

Navigate to this folder

Run the following commands
npm install
npm run client-install
npm run dev

This should now launch the sample. 

I have showed - manipulation of data through node js and allowing get requests, updating the data on the front end and mobile scaling (only minimal in this but you can see i use min-width not max-width for faster phone css)

Ensuring only the right components update and making the front end light to run.
